### I'm Thomas Harding.

I'm a full stack software looking to push myself into whatever skills I can to find out how I can help people, whether that's learning a new programming language, a new spoken language, or just finding out what people need to be done.

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, R, SQL, PostgreSQL, VSCode

Pronouns: He/Him

I have high-functioning autism, which means I might not be the best at talking to you, but I'll be very good at finding details and makign sure things are done exactly the way they should be. Please be patient and let me know what I can do to help me help you.
